# Learning systems of Ordinary Differential Equations using standard Symbolic Regression
Refactoring of the Symbolic Regression for systems of Ordinary Differential Equations project.

The original repository is here: https://github.com/albertotonda/eureqa-differential-equations

## Benchmarks
Right now I have just a few benchmarks. But there are people who worked on a repository of benchmarks for ODEs. https://www.cse.chalmers.se/~dag/identification/Benchmarks/Problems.html

ODEBench is a modern version, with a lot of stuff pre-prepared by the people running ODEFormer.
