# Learning systems of Ordinary Differential Equations using standard Symbolic Regression

This repository contains the code and data for a series of works on learning ODE systems (system identification) using symbolic regression. Employing classical symbolic regression on dynamical systems requires applying a data transformation to the trajectory/time series data. Three different data transformations have been proposed in literature:
1. $\Delta_x$
2. $F_x$
3. $\mathcal{C}_x$

## Testing data transformation approaches
The results reported in the publications below can be reproduced running scripts in Python and Julia. To run the experiments, you will first need to check out the repository using Git, or download it as a .zip file to then unzip it to a folder.

### Performance of ground truth equation
The aim of this first set of experiments is to assess the performance of the ground truth (known) equations that generated the original trajectory data, in the space generated by the transformations. Surprisingly, sometimes the ground truth equation has a poor performance in that space, misleading symbolic regression.  

To evaluate the $\Delta_x$ and $F_x$ data transformation, the Python script can be called with:

```
cd utils
python check_odebench_all_transformations.py
```

The results will be saved to a directory named `/local_results/check_odebench_all_transformations` from the root of the local copy of the repository.
